## Application Summary
This application was built using ASP.NET Core with razor pages. I wanted to sharpen my skills with razor pages and skills of using outside data to build a web application. I wanted to have fun with this project so I combined both my hobbies (sports and coding) into one and this is what came out of that. 

## Application Technologies
ASP.NET Core
Bootstrap
